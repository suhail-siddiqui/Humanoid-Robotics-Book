# Practical Exercises: Lesson 2.1 - Physical Design of Humanoid Robots

## Exercise 1: Design Comparison Analysis
Analyze three different humanoid robots (e.g., ASIMO, Atlas, NAO, or others of your choice) and compare their design approaches. For each robot, address:
- Primary design priorities and target applications
- Key physical characteristics (height, weight, DOF)
- Design trade-offs evident in their construction
- How the design aligns with its intended use case

Create a table to organize your comparisons and write a summary of how application requirements drive physical design decisions.

## Exercise 2: Conceptual Robot Design
Design a conceptual humanoid robot for a specific application (e.g., elderly care, industrial work, education, space exploration). In your design:
- Define the primary application and environmental constraints
- Specify the required height, weight, and degrees of freedom
- Describe the materials and construction approach
- Justify your design choices based on the application requirements
- Identify potential design trade-offs and how you've addressed them
- Include a basic sketch (hand-drawn or digital) of your design

## Exercise 3: Center of Mass Analysis
Using the Python example file `humanoid-design-demo.py` as a reference, modify the parameters to explore how different design choices affect the center of mass and stability:
- Change link lengths and masses to see how it affects the COM height
- Adjust the hip height and observe the impact on total height vs. stability
- Experiment with different configurations to optimize the stability margin
- Document your findings about how design changes influence robot stability

## Exercise 4: DOF Optimization Challenge
Consider how many degrees of freedom would be optimal for a humanoid robot designed for household assistance:
- List the minimum DOF required for basic tasks (walking, reaching, grasping)
- Identify additional DOF that would enhance capability
- Analyze the trade-offs between complexity and functionality
- Justify your recommended DOF allocation for each body part

## Exercise 5: Design Constraints Research
Research and list the regulatory requirements that influence humanoid robot design:
- Identify safety standards applicable to humanoid robots
- Note any electrical/EMC regulations
- Consider accessibility standards if the robot will interact with humans
- Identify environmental regulations that might apply based on the robot's operational environment

Write a brief summary of how these constraints influence design decisions.

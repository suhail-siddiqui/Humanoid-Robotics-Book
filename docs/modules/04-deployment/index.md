# Chapter 4: Building & Deploying Humanoid Robots

This chapter addresses the practical aspects of developing, testing, and deploying humanoid robots in real-world environments. It covers hardware integration with AI systems, ROS2 frameworks for robotics applications, real-time control considerations, safety protocols, and testing frameworks for validating humanoid robot systems.

## Lessons in This Chapter

1. [Lesson 4.1: Hardware Integration with AI Systems](./lesson-1-hardware-integration.md) - Designing hardware-software interfaces, integrating sensors with AI systems, and planning for real-time performance requirements.

2. [Lesson 4.2: ROS2, Real-time Control, and Robotics Software Stack](./lesson-2-ros2-rt-stack.md) - Working with ROS2 for robotics applications, designing real-time control systems, and understanding the complete robotics software stack.

3. [Lesson 4.3: Safety Protocols and Real-world Testing](./lesson-3-safety-protocols.md) - Implementing safety protocols for robotics, designing testing frameworks, and planning for ethical deployment of humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

# Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Architecture

This chapter covers the physical and structural aspects of humanoid robotics, focusing on the design principles, component selection, and mechanical systems that form the foundation of humanoid robots. It explores the complex relationship between physical design, actuation systems, and locomotion strategies.

## Lessons in This Chapter

1. [Lesson 2.1: Physical Design of Humanoid Robots](./lesson-1-physical-design.md) - Design principles for humanoid robots, human-inspired morphology, structural considerations, degrees of freedom, anthropomorphic design, and form-factor trade-offs.

2. [Lesson 2.2: Actuators, Motors, Joints, and Sensors](./lesson-2-actuators-sensors.md) - Servo motors, linear actuators, joint mechanisms, sensor integration (IMU, encoders, force/torque, tactile sensors), and component selection criteria.

3. [Lesson 2.3: Locomotion, Balance, and Gait Control](./lesson-3-locomotion-balance.md) - Walking algorithms, balance control, zero moment point (ZMP), center of mass management, dynamic vs. static stability, and gait pattern generation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, readers will:

- Understand the design principles underlying humanoid robot construction
- Identify key actuator and sensor technologies used in humanoid robotics
- Analyze different approaches to locomotion and balance in humanoid systems
- Evaluate trade-offs between different mechanical design choices

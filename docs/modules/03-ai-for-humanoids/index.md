# Chapter 3: AI for Humanoids

This chapter delves into the artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques that enable intelligent behavior in humanoid robots. It covers reinforcement learning for motor control, multimodal perception systems, and cognitive architectures that allow humanoid robots to make intelligent decisions in complex environments.

## Lessons in This Chapter

1. [Lesson 3.1: Reinforcement Learning for Motor Control](./lesson-1-reinforcement-learning.md) - RL fundamentals for robotics, policy optimization, deep RL for humanoid control, and sample-efficient learning approaches.

2. [Lesson 3.2: Vision, Audio, and Multimodal Perception](./lesson-2-perception.md) - Computer vision for robotics, audio processing, sensor fusion, and perception for human-robot interaction.

3. [Lesson 3.3: Cognitive Architectures and Reasoning](./lesson-3-cognitive-architectures.md) - Knowledge representation, planning systems, reasoning under uncertainty, and integration of multiple cognitive capabilities.

# Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI

This chapter establishes the fundamental concepts that differentiate physical AI from classical AI, introducing readers to the importance of embodied intelligence in robotics systems. It sets the foundation for all subsequent chapters.

## Lessons in This Chapter

1. [Lesson 1.1: Introduction to Physical AI](./lesson-1-introduction-to-physical-ai.md) - Definition and scope of Physical AI, how it differs from classical AI approaches, historical perspective and evolution of embodied intelligence, key challenges in creating intelligent physical systems, and overview of applications and use cases.

2. [Lesson 1.2: Embodied Cognition and Intelligence](./lesson-2-embodied-cognition.md) - Core principles of embodied cognition, how physical form influences intelligence, examples of embodied intelligence in nature vs. engineering, the role of sensors and actuators in creating intelligence, and sensorimotor contingencies and their importance.

3. [Lesson 1.3: Physics and Real-World Constraints in AI Systems](./lesson-3-physics-and-constraints.md) - Understanding physical laws in AI design, real-world constraints (dynamics, friction, uncertainty), robustness and adaptability in uncertain environments, energy efficiency in embodied systems, and the role of simulation in physical AI development.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, readers will:

- Understand the core concepts that differentiate physical AI from classical AI
- Appreciate the importance of embodied intelligence in robotics applications
- Be able to identify key challenges in creating intelligent physical systems
- Recognize when physical embodiment is necessary vs. when classical AI suffices
